How to setup Laravel and learn the basics

1. Install composer
2. Install wamp or xampp or php so you can refrence php in the path of your global environment(i use wamp's php)
2. install laravel locally or create a laravel project with composer(google it)
	to set laravel environment variable run this command
	# setx /M path "%path%;%appdata%\Composer\vendor\bin"
	once set the variables 
		# laravel new LaravelApp (run this cmd into the directory where you want your project to be created)
	>for the first time creating a new laravel app takes some time but once it's cached it won't take much time next time
3. once the laravel environment is downloaded and setup create a phpstorm project out of it
4. There are three things you must know about
	i. App/Http/routes.php (routes that defines the links in the urls)
	ii. App/Http/Controllers (Controllers that are given tasks to perform)
	iii. resources/views/ (The views that are static html files will be responsible for showing stuff; they are controlled by specific controllers that are created in the App/Http/controllers)

5. now goto your laravelApp's root directory and run cmd
	# php -S localhost:8888 -t public

	> now open localhost:8888 and you will see your laravel app running make some changes and notice


6. "# php artisan " is the main cmd used in laravel the most
7. goto .env file and setup your database connection entries. config/database.php and you will see which db type you want to use
7. laravel has a couple of necessary tables already created for you. For creating your database just simply do this
	# php artisan migrate (and you will see your default tables created)
8. #php artisan migrate:rollback (roles back the last table created and the iteration is defined in batch tab of laravel's default table(migrations) in the database)

9. creating your own type of table # php artisan make:migration create_articles_table --create="articles"
	--create defines default code for a table named articles inside the file that has been created in the migrations folder













Create your own migration
	#php artican make:migration creating_my_migration_table --create"juni"
	1. goto app folder and look for migrations folder you will see your migration listed there
	2. edit the file as per the fields you want to create in the database
	3. 








































































The PATH for Windows:
I’ve found the location where composer stores the Vendor files.

So instead of ~/.composer/vendor/bin, on Windows the following path should be used:

C:\Users\<COMPUTER NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin


How to install the Laravel Installer:
I assume you have php and composer in your PATH already.

First of all install the Laravel Installer. Open a command prompt and enter:

composer global require "laravel/installer=~1.1"

Then update the PATH environment variable via e.g. command prompt with admin privileges:

setx /M path "%path%;%appdata%\Composer\vendor\bin"
%appdata% is added, so you don’t have to worry about adding your computer name.


How to create a fresh Laravel Installation:
Now you should be able to run laravel commands in the command prompt.

To create a fresh laravel installation, open a command prompt in the directory of choice and enter:

laravel new name_of_directory
If everything went right, you should see the following message:

Crafting application...
Application ready! Build something amazing.
